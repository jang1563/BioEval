This metabolic shift provides several advantages:\n\n1. **Rapid ATP production**: Although less efficient per glucose molecule, glycolysis produces ATP faster than oxidative phosphorylation\n2. **Biosynthetic precursors**: Glycolysis generates intermediates needed for synthesizing nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids required for cell division\n3. **NADPH production**: Through the pentose phosphate pathway, cells generate reducing equivalents needed for biosynthesis\n4. **pH regulation**: Lactate export helps manage intracellular pH\n\nRather than being driven by mitochondrial dysfunction, the Warburg effect is orchestrated by oncogenes (like c-Myc, Ras) and tumor suppressors (like p53) that regulate metabolic enzymes. Many cancer cells actually maintain functional mitochondria and can switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation depending on conditions.\n\nSome cancer cells do have mitochondrial abnormalities, but these are generally consequences rather than causes of the metabolic reprogramming, or they may contribute to but don't fully explain the Warburg effect.\n\n**Confidence:** HIGH\n**Reasoning:** This topic has been extensively studied with consistent findings across multiple research groups showing functional mitochondria in most cancer cells, and the molecular mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming are well-characterized.",
